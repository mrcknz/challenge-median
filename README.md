# Median of two sorted, equal-length arrays

There are 2 ascendinlgy sorted arrays A and B of size n each. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays (i.e. array of length 2n). 

There is a relatively simple solution with time complexity O(2 log(n)). Try finding a solution with O(log(n))!
